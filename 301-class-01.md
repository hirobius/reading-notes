## Passing Data through "Props"

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. 

### Tutorial snippets

Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children.

To “remember” things, components use state.

React components can have state by setting this.state in their constructors. this.state should be considered as private to a React component that it’s defined in.

In JavaScript classes, you need to always call ```super``` when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a ```super(props)``` call.

The React DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components.

When the Board’s state changes, the Square components re-render automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the Board component will allow it to determine the winner in the future.

Since the Square components no longer maintain state, the Square components receive values from the Board component and inform the Board component when they’re clicked. **In React terms, the Square components are now controlled components. The Board has full control over them.**

### Immutability

The end result is the same but by not mutating (or changing the underlying data) directly, we gain several benefits described below.

Detecting changes in immutable objects is considerably easier. If the immutable object that is being referenced is different than the previous one, then the object has changed.

The main benefit of immutability is that it helps you build *pure components* in React. Immutable data can easily determine if changes have been made, which helps to determine when a component requires re-rendering.

In React, function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and don’t have their own state.

## Hello World + Intro to JSX

Elements and Components are the BUILDING BLOCKS of React Apps. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write.

JSX is a Syntax Extension to JavaScript.

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

JSX produces React “elements”.

*JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.*

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code.

You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
```const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;```

You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:
```const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;```

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
```const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;```

### Rendering an element into the DOM

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

### Updating the Rendered Element

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

In practice, most React apps only call ```ReactDOM.render()``` once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.

## Components and Props

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.

*
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.*

---

### Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

*An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a ReferenceError:*

---

Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.

React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags.

Components can refer to other components in their output.

Don't be afraid to split components into smaller components. *We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used*

---

Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.

---

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**
