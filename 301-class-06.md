# Intro to Node

## Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

---

Node programs aren't actually executed in a browser. Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a ***JavaScript runtime***.

---

You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing ```node -v```

Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript. This means that you generally don't have to worry about compatibility issues.

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry.

Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server. The queue of tasks are managed with callbacks in a stack like that one ted talk about the event loop.

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites.

---

There are various frameworks you can use to reduce the boilerplate, with Express having established itself as the front runner. Yet even a solution such as Express is minimal, meaning that if you want to do anything slightly out of the ordinary, you’ll need to pull in additional modules from npm. This is in stark contrast to frameworks such as Rails or Laravel, which come with a lot of functionality out of the box.

---

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.

Node can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. It can also be used to write your own command line tool, such as this Yeoman-Style generator to scaffold out new projects.

Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots. What’s not to love?

---

***Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.***

## Pair Programming (Reread)

2 heads are better than one.

Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary

Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea

Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey

Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey

---

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

idk wut axios is lol

#### Async Programming...

Async functions and the ```await``` keyword... These features basically act as syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and to read afterwards. They make async code look more like old-school synchronous code, so they're well worth learning

So the async keyword is added to functions to tell them to return a promise rather than directly returning the value...

await can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value.

I still don't quite get it...
