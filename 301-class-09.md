# Functional Programming

## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." — John Outerhout (Enough said.)

## Pure Functions

**Functional programming is a programming paradigm** — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Mutability is discouraged in functional programming.

Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result. We don’t need to think of situations when the same parameter has different results — because it will never happen.

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

## Immutability

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

We can handle this mutation by doing function composition, or function chaining. In other words, the result of a function will be used as an input for the next function, without modifying the original input string.

---

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

***pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency***

The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.

Functions as first-class entities can:

- refer to it from constants and variables
- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions

## Higher-order functions

When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:

- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result

```const even = n => n % 2 == 0;```

```const listOfNumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];```

```listOfNumbers.filter(even); // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]```

---

The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

Declarative JS example, kinda saucy, I like it:

```const makeSentence = (person) => `${person.name} is ${person.age} years old`;```

```const peopleSentences = (people) => people.map(makeSentence);```
  
```peopleSentences(people); ['TK is 26 years old', 'Kaio is 10 years old', 'Kazumi is 30 years old']```

---

We know how immutability is important to make our functions more consistent and predictable. 

---

Do you remember that a higher order function can receive a function as an argument and use it? Yes, map can do it!

---

The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.

## Refactoring JS for Performance and Readability

There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.

A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table.

Return early from functions:

Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences:

Refactored code, doesn't always mean a lower character count... mostly it means that it's clearer, cleaner and more usable

It's important to get your code right the first time because in many businesses there isn't much value in refactoring. Or at least, it's hard to convince stakeholders that eventually uncared for codebases will grind productivity to a halt.
