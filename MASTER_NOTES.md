IDE: Integrated Development Environment

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.


The Terminal, aka the CLI / Command Line Interface



Terminal 

whoami

echo "hello, terminal"
echo $PATH
echo $USER

clear (clear out the terminal screen)
pwd: present working directory

ls
cd *(change directory)*

ls -l
ls -a
ls .

mkdir subDir

if stuck in VIM press: ; + q + enter

rm (remove)
rm -rf subDir (completely remove a directory)

###### manuals
man chmod
man rm
man ls
man cd
