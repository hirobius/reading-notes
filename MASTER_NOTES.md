IDE: Integrated Development Environment

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.


The Terminal, aka the CLI / Command Line Interface



Terminal 

whoami

echo "hello, terminal"
echo $PATH
echo $USER

clear (clear out the terminal screen)
pwd: present working directory

ls
cd *(change directory)*

ls -l
ls -a
ls .

mkdir subDir


if stuck in VIM press: ; + q + enter

rm (remove file)

rmdir (remove directory)

rm -rf subDir (completely remove a directory)

In the readme, all you want is a header and the Table of Contents


### Basic Navigation 
Beginning commands:

pwd — Print Working Directory

ls — This shows us what is in our current location

ls -a — This will List the contents of a directory, including hidden files. (there are multiple ways to run ls which I'm assuming I'll pick up later)

[] square brackets mean that an item is optional


**cd** followed by the following will bring you up in the directory:

~ (tilde) — This is a reference to your home directory.

. (dot) — This is a reference to your current directory.

.. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. 

***cd is the golden ticket to go places and actually navigate***


mkdir — make directory

ls — List the contents of a directory.

rm -rf — big kid version of delete (be very careful)

rmdir — Remove directory

ls -a look for 


### Key takeaways to practice:

pwd — Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

cd — Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

ALWAYS MAKE A README for every repo you ever create. Best Practice.

```touch``` to create
```rm``` to remove
```cd -``` to move back up one folder
```popd``` to return to previous directory

To do:
Create a list of recurring errors
Create / find a cheat sheet of terminal commands
Customize your shell appearance and functions
