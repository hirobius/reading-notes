**The document object.** represents an HTML page.

Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.

The document object is just one of a set of objects that all major browsers support. When the browser creates a model of a web page, it not only creates a document object, but it also creates a new object for each element on the page. Together these objects are described in the **Document Object Model**.

| Event | Happens when: |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |


The document object has:

**Properties** that describe characteristics of the current web page (such as the title of the page).

**Methods** perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser (such as getting information from a specified element or adding new content).

**Events** can be responded to, such as a user clicking or tapping an element.
