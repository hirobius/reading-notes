### Version Control

In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are like a dynamic "history" record that you can revert your work back to, keep track edits including who edited what and when.

These can be stored locally as a **Local** VCS on your Hard Drive. 

The need to be able to collaborate led to a Centralized VCS (CVCS) which is accessible by various clients all at once.

But in case things broke or became corrupted, there was the advent of the Distributed VCS (DVCS) which permitted "mirrored" iterations of one repository that could easily repair or replace any mishaps or lost info. This also enabled more dynamic collaboration methods and workflows.


### So What is Git?

Git is a DVCS and saves "snapshots" of your work every time you save.

Git relies on local information in order to speed up the fetching of information (doing so from a remote server is slower) and you are also able to continue working while offline :)

Git is very smart and tracks every little detail, good or bad, which makes it difficult for you to actually lose work!


### Git Stages

Committed: Data is securely stored in a local database.

Modified: File has been changed but not "committed" to the database.

Staged: A file's changed version is ready to be committed to the next snapshot.

History: Git was created by the founder of Linux kernel, dude named Linus Torvalds, and is now one of the most widely used VCS in the world.



### Customization

Git comes with a built in GUI, but you can download additional GUI clients [HERE](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

The built-in ```git config``` is pretty much the settings directory which allows the configuration of variables that control aspects of Gitâ€™s operation and look.


**To set your Identity *(username and email address)* for every Git commit, type the following into the command line:**

``` 
git config --global user.name "Jane Smith"
git config --global user.email "example@email.com"
```

**To confirm everything's working, type the following into the command line**

```
git config --global user.name (should return Jane Smith)

git config --global user.email (should return example@email.com)
```

By using ```--global``` you are doing system-wide changes, so if you only want to affect the contents of the current directory then don't use it.


### Default Text Editor
By using ```git config --global core.editor (editor name here)``` you can change the default Text editor. For some editors there are different steps to accomplish this.


### Check Settings
To check settings, use the ```git config --list``` command.

### Getting Help
```
git help (command here no parentheses)
git (command here no parentheses) --help
man git-(command here no parentheses)
```
