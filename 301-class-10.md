# The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary 

An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

The understanding of the call stack is vital to Asynchronous programming (which we will look at in a later article).

In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

## What causes a stack overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

The function will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded”. And that is a stack overflow.

## Types of error messages

The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message that the one we saw just moments ago, it usually appears on your console (being developer tools of the browser, terminal or whatever else you are using).

### Reference Errors

Not defined.

### Syntax Errors

Like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

### Range Errors

Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up

### Type Errors

These types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

## Debugging

The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

You can run the debugger by pressing F5 or pressing the green play button.

Console logs are your friend too

Another way to see the stack trace at any given point in your code is to just write console.trace() were you want to log it.

### Call Stack

Paired with breakpoints it is easier to create a code execution in scenarios like this by taking into account the call stack which is available, for example, in chrome developer tools “sources” tab.

The call stack it’s better to navigate when you have names to your functions, meaning that if you use anonymous functions you will most probably have an harder time since the call stack will not show the name of the parent function.

## Handling Errors

An alternative it’s to encapsulate our problematic function code with a try…catch which would make an error be thrown but this time, not “uncaught” so we can send it to a error logging to be checked later and send a fallback to the function so that our code continues without problems.
