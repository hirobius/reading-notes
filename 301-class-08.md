# Class-08 - APIs

## WEB API Design

A Well-designed API should aim to support: **Platform Independence** and **Service Evolution**

### Platform Independence

Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally.

### Service Evolution

The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications.

## Introduction to REST

Representational State Transfer. A primary advantage of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards, and does not bind the implementation of the API or the client applications to any specific implementation. For example, a REST web service could be written in ASP.NET, and client applications can use any language or toolset that can generate HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses.

REST APIs are designed around *resources*, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

URI - Uniform Resource Identifier

A resource has an *identifier*, which is a URI that uniquely *identifies* that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

```https://adventure-works.com/orders/1```

Clients interact with a service by exchanging *representations* of resources. Many web APIs use JSON as the exchange format.

---

In more complex systems, it can be tempting to provide URIs that enable a client to navigate through several levels of relationships, such as /customers/1/orders/99/products. However, this level of complexity can be difficult to maintain and is inflexible if the relationships between resources change in the future.

Instead, try to keep URIs relatively simple. Once an application has a reference to a resource, it should be possible to use this reference to find items related to that resource. 

**TIP:** Avoid requiring resource URIs more complex than collection/item/collection.

---

Avoid introducing dependencies between the web API and the underlying data sources. For example, if your data is stored in a relational database, the web API doesn't need to expose each table as a collection of resources. In fact, that's probably a poor design. Instead, think of the web API as an abstraction of the database. If necessary, introduce a mapping layer between the database and the web API. That way, client applications are isolated from changes to the underlying database scheme.

**The common HTTP methods used by most RESTful web APIs are:**

- **GET** retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
- **POST** creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
- **PUT** either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
- **PATCH** performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
- **DELETE** removes the resource at the specified URI.

A POST request creates a resource.

A PUT request creates a resource or updates an existing resource.

A PATCH request performs a partial update to an existing resource.

### GET Methods

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK). If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

### POST Methods

If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created)

### DELETE methods
If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204, indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).

---

## Filter and Paginate Data

Consider supporting query strings that specify the maximum number of items to retrieve and a starting offset into the collection. For example:

```/orders?limit=25&offset=50```

Also consider imposing an upper limit on the number of items returned, to help prevent Denial of Service attacks. 

---

One of the primary motivations behind REST is that it should be possible to navigate the entire set of resources without requiring prior knowledge of the URI scheme. 

**HATEOAS**

Each HTTP GET request should return the information necessary to find the resources related directly to the requested object through hyperlinks included in the response, and it should also be provided with information that describes the operations available on each of these resources. This principle is known as HATEOAS, or Hypertext as the Engine of Application State. The system is effectively a finite state machine, and the response to each request contains the information necessary to move from one state to another; no other information should be necessary.

---

It is highly unlikely that a web API will remain static. If more radical changes to the schema of resources occur (such as removing or renaming fields) or the relationships between resources change then these may constitute breaking changes that prevent existing client applications from functioning correctly.

**URI Versionining**: Each time you modify the web API or change the schema of resources, you add a version number to the URI for each resource. The previously existing URIs should continue to operate as before, returning resources that conform to their original schema.
