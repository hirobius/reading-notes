## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)

Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.

You can also use a pair of pixels
or percentages. These represent
the distance from the top left
corner of the browser window
(or containing box). The top left
corner is equal to 0% 0%. The
example shown, with values of

The advantage of using sprites is
that the web browser only needs
to request one image rather than
many images, which can make
the web page load faster.
