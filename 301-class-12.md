# SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set

For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )
