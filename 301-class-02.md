# State and Lifecycle

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

## Converting a Function to a Class

- Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
- Add a single empty method to it called render().
- Move the body of the function into the render() method.
- Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
- Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

## Add Local State to a Class

Class components should always call the base constructor with props.

In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed. 

Mounting and Unmounting "Lifecycle Methods" are critical.

## Using State Correctly

Three things to know about ```setState()```

1. Do Not Modify State Directly
   - instead use ```setState()```
   - The only place where you can assign ```this.state``` is the constructor.
2. State Updates may be Asynchronous
   - React may "batch" multiple ```setState()``` calls into a single update for performance
3. State Updates are Merged
   - When you call ```setState()```, React merges the object you provide into the current state

## Data Flows Down

Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class. This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it. A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:

This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them in the tree.

You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.

## Handling Events

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

i.e.:

```<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>```

When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

*You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.*

*This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.*

## Conditional Rerendering

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods.
