##### Day 1: Reflection Discussion
To sum up most of what I've learned today: **GitHub** is a platform where you can create code repositories which are essentially *simple* websites with pages capable of adapting more complex custom themes and a wide array of syntax / styling options that are fairly straightfowrard to implement. 
The key takeaway from GitHub is that it is focused on elevating the CONTENT / conveying it in a more simple and concise way than say building a raw website in HTML+CSS. 
This is good for things like documentation or other items where you want to cut right to the core of the needed information.

You can include imagery, external and internal links *(other pages in a repository)*, tables, emojis, basic text styling, lists and other hierarchical treatments.
GitHub has other powerful features that have yet to reveal themselves to me, but that is another good reason to learn it: Adventure!
