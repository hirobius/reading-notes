# Computer architecture and Logic

## What makes a computer a computer?

Designed to help us with THINKING Work.

Designed to manipulate information as "Thinking machines".

Take Input.

Store data.

Process it. A processor takes information from memoru and manipulates it with an algorithm (series of commands) then returns it to storage. This process continues until the info is ready for output.

Output it. 


# Binary & Data

Noone really deals with 1's and 0's on the outside, but they are real important on the inside.

Inside are electric wires and circuits.

Single wire with electricity moving through it has only 2 options. On or off.

The on off state of a single wire is called a BIT. Smallest piece of info a computer can store. More wires, more bits, more complex info.

## Binary # System

only 2 digits, 0 and 1 and each position moving up is multiplied by 2.

with 32 wires, you can store numbers from 0 - 4 billion

Images, sounds can also be represented by #'s.


## Circuits and Logic

Every input or output from a computer is effectively a type of information. Which can be represented by on/ off switches.

In order to output, computers combine electric components into circuit.

They do a process of complex joint calculations. 

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

Input devices take input and convert it into binary. 

Memory stores the information. 

CPU / Central processing unit.

Output devices can be a screen, motors, speakers or whatever

oftentimes multiple CPUS and memrory for highly complex info

## Hardware and Software

Hardware & Software talk to each other through the CPU

Operating system: The Master Program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
