# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

These are essentially the core building blocks of soem intermediate CSS manipulations.

Keyframes and motion design and micro-interactions for days. Some good bookmark material. 

There wasn't really any content within that I haven't came across in some form, but a decent amount of the code was definitely a bit more elaborate than I was expecting. 

## Key Takeaways

Complex animations require multiple keyframes. You can do easing and all kinds of transformations and change the timing of them and add multiple keyframes for more control.
