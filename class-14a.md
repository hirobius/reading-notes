These are essentially the core building blocks of soem intermediate CSS manipulations.

Keyframes and motion design and micro-interactions for days. Some good bookmark material.

## Key Takeaways

Complex animations require multiple keyframes. You can do easing and all kinds of transformations and change the timing of them and add multiple keyframes for more control.
