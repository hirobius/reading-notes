## Questions

### 1. Difference between PUT and PATCH
  PATCH is used to update an existing entity with new information. You can’t patch an entity that doesn’t exist.
  PUT is used to set an entity’s information completely. PUTting is similar to POSTing, except that it will overwrite the entity if already exists or create it otherwise.
  (The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.)
