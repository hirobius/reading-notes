# React and Forms

## Controlled Components

We can combine the ```state``` property and the individual states of different form elements by making the React state the "single source of truth". This way, the React component that renders the form also controls what happens in the form.

Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be ```this.state.value```, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

With a controlled component, the inputâ€™s value is always driven by the React state.

While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

```this.state = {value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'};```

```handleChange(event) {this.setState({value: event.target.value});}```

```<textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />```

Things like selected values in dropdown lists are more conveniently updated as they only need to be updated in one place.

## Handling Multiple Inputs

When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.
