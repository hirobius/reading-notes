# Lab: 01b - Learning Markdown â€” Adrian M

***To me, having a growth mindset means that you realize your own abilities can be developed through work and commitment.***

    Work beats talent when talent doesn't work.
    Burnout is real.
    Be Grateful.

My name is Adrian. I have plenty to talk about but prefer to say more with less. 

###### Kindness is key, Onward and Upward, Gratitude is the attitude
