## Welcome to Adrian's Code 102 Lab 01b Notes

***To me, having a growth mindset means that you realize your own abilities can be developed through work and commitment.***

    Work beats talent when talent doesn't work.
    Burnout is real.
    Be Grateful.


###### Kindness is key
###### Onward and Upward
###### Gratitude is the attitude
