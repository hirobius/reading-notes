## Welcome to Adrian's Code 102 Lab 01b Notes

Growth mindset, to me, means that a human's most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. 

Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard/smart.
Remember to unplug and pay attention to your core pillars to stay sharp and healthy.
Keep moving forward / Onward and Upward / Just Keep Swimming

Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your page
Be sure to introduce yourself, and include a link to your GitHub portfolio page


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hirobius/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hirobius/reading-notes/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
