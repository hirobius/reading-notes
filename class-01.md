## How the Web Works

In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

You connect to the web through an **ISP** / Internet Service Provider.

You type a domain name / web address into your browser to visit a site.

Your computer then contacts a network of servers called a DNS / Domain Name System. (These act like phone books and tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.) IP addresses are up to 12 characters long separated by periods.

The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server.

The web server then sends the page you requested back to your browser.
