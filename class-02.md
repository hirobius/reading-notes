# Stuff I didn't know:

## Text

**Line Breaks:** '''<br />'''
**Horizontal Rules:** '''<hr />'''

## Semantic Markup

**Emphasis:** '''<em>'''
**Blockquote:** '''<blockquote>'''>
**Abbreviations:** '''<abbr>'''
**Define:** '''<dfn>''' *(The first time you explain some new terminology)*
**Insert and Delete:** '''<ins>''' and '''<del>'''

Semantics are good because it can actually inform the browser on the contents of the page thus heightening its effectiveness.


# Introducing CSS

CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration.**

**Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.

**Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

---

**Properties** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.

**Values** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

## Selectors

* {} (Universal Selector)
h1, h2, h3 {} (Type Selector)
.note (Class Selector)
#note (ID Selector)
li>a {} (Child Selector)
p a {} (Descendant Selector)
h1+p {} (Adjacent Sibling Selector)
h1~p {} (General Sibling Selector)

# Basic Javascript Instructions

Statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line and ends with a semicolon.
Statements can be organized into code blocks.

You should write comments to explain what your code does. i.e.:
'''/* This script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time. It is an example from JavaScript & jQuery book */'''

Single line JS comments are like so: '''// comment goes here'''

Numbers, Strings & Booleans are the only data types.

***Variables can be written with Shorthand*** (You should study up on this.)

**Arrays** can store a list of values. Study these as well.

**Operators** should be mastered too. Assignment, Arithmetic, String, Comparison, Logical.


# Decisions & Loops

There will come a time when you will need a flowcharts to sculpt your scripts. That is where **Evaluations, Decisions & Loops** come in as well as **Comparison Operators**.

Conditionals and If statements :)

### Comparison Operators

== Is equal to
!= Is not equal to
=== Strict Equal to
!== Strict Not Equal to

(Study up on some common terms like "getElementById)

### Logical Operators

&& Logical And
|| Logical Or
! Logical Not

ifs and if else are a bit easier for me so far. Let's hope that holds up.
