# REST

"the first part" (in most cases http) tells the browser what protocol to use

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”

Machines don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

Yes, it is. Our brains are somehow smart enough to know that the same verbs, like GET, can be applied to many different nouns. Some verbs are more specific than others and apply only to a small set of nouns. For instance, I can't drive a cup and I can't drink a car. But some verbs are almost universal like GET, PUT, and DELETE.

Brother: And they use the nouns and verbs!

ME: Exactly. Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.

Brother: So this is what software developers work on now? Deciding how to best model the data?

ME: More or less, this is what engineers do in the web development world, thanks almost entirely to the popularity of RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

We are done. Now, we just tell Rails what we want our data to look like, and it takes care of all of the communication pieces for us. It's a huge boost for productivity!

Foreshadowing.
