# ES6 Classes

## Data Modeling

Constructor Functions and Prototypes

### Shred Talk: ES6 Classes

Sculpting out prototypes as base classes and creating extensions / subclasses from them is enlightening for sure.

```extends``` pretty much means "type of" 

Key thing for me: If you add a new exclusive parameter just for a subclass, you need to run the parent method to create a new instance and then add the new arguments for the parameter when instantiating. ```super(parameter1, parameter2);```

### What the HECK is the Event Loop anyway?

V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can do 1 thing at a time. 1 workaround might be asynchronous callbacks.

Web APIs and other "pieces" of the browser are where the concurrency kicks in and we are essentially accessing other "threads"

Set Timeout for example is an API provided by the browser.

After the timeout has resolved in the timeout api, the event enters the "task queue"

Then if "the stack" is empty, the event loop checks the task queue and pushes the first task queue item onto the stack, which effectively runs it.

Callbacks can be called on by another function, or they can enter the queue at some point asynchronously
