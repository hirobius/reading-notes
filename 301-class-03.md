# Passing Functions as Props

## React: Lifting State Up

Often, several components need to reflect the same, it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.

In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called “lifting state up”.

In the given example, they remove the local state from the ```TemperatureInput``` and move it into the ```Calculator``` instead.

The ```Calculator``` becomes the “source of truth” for the current temperature in both inputs. It can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other. Since F and C share the same parent component, the two inputs will always be in sync.

Side note: **PROPS ARE READ-ONLY**

---

```Value``` and ```onChange``` are common naming conventions

---

It is enough to store the value of the most recently changed input, and the scale that it represents. Now, no matter which input you edit, this.state.temperature and this.state.scale in the Calculator get updated. One of the inputs gets the value as is, so any user input is preserved, and the other input value is always recalculated based on it.

### Takeaways:

Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.

Lifting state involves writing more “boilerplate” code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs. It reduces the Surface Area for bugs to live.

If something can be derived from either props or state, it probably shouldn’t be in the state.

When you see something wrong in the UI, you can use React Developer Tools to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state. This lets you trace the bugs to their source:

## Lists and Keys

### Rendering Multiple Components

You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {} i.e.: ``` const array = [1, 2, 3]``` becomes ```{array}```

---

A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys: 

When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.

Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However they don’t need to be globally unique.

Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name.

## The Spread Operator

The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

```const numbers = [37, -17, 7, 0]```

```console.log(Math.min(numbers)) // NaN```

```console.log(Math.min(...numbers)) // -17```

```console.log(Math.max(...numbers)) // 37```

### Adding Items to a list

```const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']```

```const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]```

```console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]```

For legacy browsers / internet explorer etc... the function Function.prototype.apply() will have the same effect as the spread syntax.

One of my favorite uses of the spread syntax is when combining arrays such as when adding an item to React State.
I also like that it can quickly combine the properties of objects into a new object, though any properties whose names conflict will be lost.
Knowing the spread syntax definitely saves me time when coding, and I recommend using it to all JavaScript developers...
