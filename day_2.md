### VS seems legit. 

It's a full-on IDE. When selecting a Text Editor you need to weigh a couple factors that feel the best for the experiene you want when working in it while still remaining efficient for the job at hand.

One feature may be code completion, which is when your text editor will display possible suggestions based on what you have begun to type.
Emmet is a form of shorthand language that will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. You can have emmet built in or add it with an extension.

Syntax highlighting is another feature which provides individually different colors for attributes, elements and copy respectively so it's easier to parse the info you're reading.

The ability to add can provide you with dark backgrounds and brighter colored text, which can reduce eye strain. Or you can add other extensions to improve the functionality of your editor.
Brackets has “Live Preview” built in (which is a plus), but only supports HTML, CSS & JavaScript out of the box, meaning you will need an extension to write in further languages.
